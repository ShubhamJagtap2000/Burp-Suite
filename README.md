# Introduction: What is Burp Suite?

- **Burp Suite** is a framework written in Java that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing. In many ways, this goal is achieved as Burp is very much the industry standard tool for hands-on web app security assessments. 

- **Burp Suite** is also very commonly used when assessing mobile applications, as the same features which make it so attractive for web app testing translate almost perfectly into testing the **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) powering most mobile apps.
