# Proxying Using Burp Suite Browser

- In addition to giving us the option to modify our regular web browser to work with the proxy, Burp Suite also includes a **built-in Chromium browser** that is pre-configured to use the proxy without any of the modifications we just had to do. 
- We can start the Burp Browser with the **"Open Browser"** button in the proxy tab:

- **A Chromium** window will now pop up. Any requests we make in this will go through the proxy.

*Note: There are many settings to do with the Burp Browser in the Project options and User options tabs -- make sure to go look at them! *
