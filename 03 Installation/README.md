# Installing Burp

- Fortunately, [PortSwigger](portswigger.net) have made installing Burp Suite extremely easy on Linux, macOS, and Windows, providing dedicated installers for all three. As a Java application, Burp can also be downloaded as a JAR archive and run on effectively anything that will support a Java runtime environment.

- Burp Suite comes pre-packaged with Kali Linux, so you should not need to install it there. If, for some reason, Burp is missing from your Kali installation, you can easily install it from the Kali apt repositories.

- For other systems, we can download installers from the [Burp Suite Downloads page](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/community/latest).

- We can then click the **"Download"** button to start downloading the Burp Suite installer. No matter which operating system you are using, make sure to use **Burp Suite Community Edition**.
