# Burp Editions

# 1. Community Edition

 This is free to use for any (legal) non-commercial use. The Burp Suite Professional and Enterprise editions both require expensive licenses but come with powerful extra features
 
 # 2. Professional Edition
 
   - An automated vulnerability scanner
   - A fuzzer/bruteforcer that isn't rate limited
   - Saving projects for future use; report generation
   - A built-in API to allow integration with other tools
   - Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality
   - Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger owned server)

# 3. Enterprise Edition

Unlike the community and professional editions, Burp Enterprise is used for continuous scanning. It provides an automated scanner that can periodically scan webapps for vulnerabilities in much the same way as software like Nessus performs  automated infrastructure scanning. Unlike the other editions of Burp Suite which allow you to perform manual attacks from your own computer, Enterprise sits on a server and constantly scans target web apps for vulnerabilities.
