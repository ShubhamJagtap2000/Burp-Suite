# Positions Sub-tab

- When we are looking to perform an attack with Intruder, the first thing we need to do is look at `positions`. Positions tell Intruder where to insert payloads.

- Let's switch over to the Positions sub-tab:

- Notice that Burp will attempt to determine the most likely places we may wish to insert a payload `automatically` -- these are highlighted in green and surrounded by `silcrows (ยง)`.

- On the ***right-hand side*** of the interface, we have the buttons labelled `"Add ยง"`, `"Clear ยง"`, and `"Auto ยง"`:

   - **Add** lets us define new positions by highlighting them in the editor and clicking the button.
   - **Clear** removes all defined positions, leaving us with a blank canvas to define our own.
   - **Auto** attempts to select the most likely positions automatically; this is useful if we cleared the default positions and want them back.
